# shelves

Design for shelves that can be assembled from laser cut pieces.

## Measurements

The width of the slits defined in the CAD are `0.5`. For pieces to interlock correctly,
this should be scaled so that it matches the thickness of your material.

Example: Assuming the CAD is imported in inches, and your material is 0.2" thickness,
the model should be scaled by 0.2/0.5 -> 40%.
